Game Description:The game represented in this program is a version of a popular computer program called "Aim Lab"This program is used by professional First-person shooter game players to improve their: reflexes, accuracy, and speedThe base premise of this program is simple, targets will appear on your screen and you have to click them as fast as you can and as accurate as you can After a few targets you will end your session and be prompted with score and stats if you decide toThe implementation of this program in this python project is itself in the most simplest formThe user will be prompted a target at a time and the program will recognize if the user clicked on it or notEverytime the user clicks, the program will output wether it was on target or notAlgorithm Description:The algorithm is as follows:    The program initiates the screen in which everything will be done    It prompts the user with a message, telling the user that the game will begin once he clicks again    After the click a for loop begins and this sets in motion the majority of our game     A function will generate a target        -It will generate a random color            *This is done by assigining a random number between 10 and 256 (we start at 10 to avoid obtaining a black target, making it invisible on screen)             to three variables named 'r', 'g', 'b '  After that these variables are assigned to another variable using the 'color_rgb' function        -It will generate a random x and y coordinate            * This is done by assigning a random number between 10 and 290 (these values allow us an invisible border to avoid targets outside of frame)       - The circle will be created using the numbers assigned to x and y as its center point, with a fixed radius of 10 (10 pixels is a good size to make it difficult but not impossible)       - The targets "hitbox" is generated by creating squares that use the circles elements and making the squares sides the length of the diameter of the circle allowing us to have a very tight hit box with minimal room for error         - Once all variables are designed for the circle and the hitbox, the circle is shown on screen       - Now the user has to click said target as accurately as they can       - After a click is inputted the coordinates of this click are obtained and stored for later comparison       - The algorithm to identify wether the click is inside the hitbox or not is as follows:            - The click will compare its x coordinate and make sure its greater than the coordinate where the left side of the square is drawn but also lesser than the coordinate where the right side of the square is drawn. Likewise, it will compare the click's y coordinate and make sure it is greater than the coordinate in which the top line is drawn but lesser than the coordinate where the bottom line is drawn. If all of these conditions are met, the click was indeed inside the target's hit box.            - If the outcome is true ( the user did click on the target) a message will be shown notifying the user that his click hit            - If the outcome is false ( the user did not click on the target) a message will be shown notifying the user that his click missed        - After each click the target will be erased and the loop goes into its next iteration thus generating and showing a completely new and different target    - This loop will run for 5 times (for testing purposes). After 5 targets and clicks, the screen will go black until one more click is received, which will close the program
